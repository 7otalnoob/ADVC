<h1 align=center>GTA: Vice City - generic Linux port</h1>

This Linux/SDL3 port is based on the MIT-licensed
[gtavc_nx](https://github.com/NaGaa95/gtavc_nx) Android ARM64 loader and shims.
The Linux target is being aligned with the official **v2.11.311** `libGame.so`
(arm64-v8a), matching the upstream Android payload. It runs the user's Android
library natively in a minimal compatibility environment. Version-specific Switch
gameplay patches are not applied by the Linux target. The host input regression
suite covers v2.11.311's per-gamepad callback ABI and retains a fallback for the
older v2.11.264 count-based ABI; AArch64 v2.11.311 target validation still
requires an ARM64 Play Store split.

i made this because there's weird shady "PortMaster" archives going around [from the R36S wiki](https://r36swiki.com/wiki-gtavc.html),
which seemed to have zero build provenance and i have zero clue how it's built, so I decided
to re-port it to a more generic target myself.

And by the way, there is literally no release for this game on PortMaster, so the source of these ports going
around is very shady

### PortMaster launcher

The launcher follows the PortMaster layout and is intended to be started by
PortMaster/EmulationStation:

```text
ports/
├── Grand Theft Auto Vice City.sh
└── gtavc/
    ├── gtavc_linux
    ├── libs.aarch64/
    │   └── libSDL3.so.0
    ├── libGame.so
    ├── libc++_shared.so
    ├── assetfile.txt
    ├── Adjustable.cfg
    ├── data/
    ├── models/
    ├── texdb/
    └── audio/
```

The launcher sources PortMaster's `control.txt`, imports its controller
mapping, requires an AArch64 device, runs `pm_platform_helper`, and finishes
through `pm_finish`. It writes `gtavc/log.txt` for frontend launches. The
complete Android-package asset inventory and split/asset-pack extraction guide
is in [ASSET_PREPARATION.md](ASSET_PREPARATION.md).

`libs.aarch64/libSDL3.so.0` is built from the SDL3-to-SDL2 backend fork. It
loads the device's system `libSDL2-2.0.so.0` dynamically so PortMaster systems
retain their patched SDL2 video, audio, and joystick backends. SDL2 is not
bundled. The reproducible workflow uses the PortMaster AArch64 builder image;
the GitHub Actions workflow builds this shim rather than native SDL3.

### Linux input and audio

- SDL3 gamepads feed native controller callbacks directly: face buttons, D-pad,
  Start/Back, shoulders, stick clicks, sticks and triggers. No keyboard emulation
  or keyboard fallback. Startup discovery, hotplug, focus reset, and up to four
  contiguous controller slots are supported. `SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG` can
  override mappings; the launcher imports PortMaster's mapping when available.
- OpenAL Soft retains spatial mixing through `ALC_SOFT_loopback`; SDL3 owns the
  playback stream (48 kHz stereo float PCM). Knulli's native PipeWire socket is
  `/var/run/pipewire-0`; the launcher fills an unset `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` and selects
  PipeWire when that socket exists, without overriding explicit audio choices.
- `GTAVC_INPUT_DEBUG=1` logs native controller dispatch, and
  `GTAVC_AUDIO_DEBUG=1` reports mixed/non-silent PCM counters every five seconds.
  Counters are diagnostics, not proof that speakers are audible.
- The TRIMUI Smart Pro S controller and game audio were user-confirmed on Knulli.

### Exit controls

The launcher handles a PortMaster-style quit chord outside the Android game
input layer: hold **Guide/Home and press Start**, or hold **Back/Select/Minus and
press Start**. This requests a clean shutdown of the native game, audio stream, and
SDL controller handles. Releasing only one button does not exit. A standalone
SDL window's close/quit event also exits.

The game itself receives Start and Back as ordinary native gamepad buttons. The
v2.11.264 Android `implOnBackButtonPressed` entry point is a no-op, so the port
does not claim that Back alone pauses or exits the game.

The quit chord is a compile-time option and is enabled by default. Disable it
with `-DGTAVC_QUIT_CHORD=OFF` when configuring CMake, or explicitly enable it
with `-DGTAVC_QUIT_CHORD=ON`.

Host tests (SDL3/OpenAL development packages required):

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-linux -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build-linux -j2
ctest --test-dir build-linux --output-on-failure
```

The input test uses SDL virtual gamepads and mocked native callbacks; the audio
test uses real OpenAL mixing with SDL's dummy output. On-device, run
`audio_linux_test` with `SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER=pipewire` for two short tones, or set
`GTAVC_AUDIO_TEST_MS=5000` for two five-second tones. See `AGENTS.md` for the
persistent cross-build and hardware-testing workflow.

### Binary release package

After the AArch64 build and vendored runtime files are present, create a
reproducible drop-in tarball with:

```sh
scripts/package-linux.sh 1.0.0
```

This writes `dist/gtavc-linux-1.0.0.tar.gz` and a `.sha256` sidecar. The archive
contains the launcher, `gtavc_linux`, `libs.aarch64/libSDL3.so.0`, the vendored Android NDK C++
runtime, and the 120-entry `assetfile.txt` manifest. It deliberately does not
contain `libGame.so` or proprietary game assets; those are added from the
matching official Android package during installation. The default package also
includes the existing `Adjustable.cfg` console-style HUD layout. Set
`GTAVC_CONSOLE_UI=0` when invoking the packager to omit it.

### Original Switch installation (upstream reference only)

You're going to need:
* the **arm64-v8a** `.apk` (and `.obb`) for version **2.11.311**.

To install:
1. Create a folder called `gtavc` in the `switch` folder on your SD card.
2. From the **arm64-v8a** APK, extract these two native libraries to
   `/switch/gtavc/`:
   * `lib/arm64-v8a/libGame.so`
   * `lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so`
3. Extract the **game data** so the files sit loose under `/switch/gtavc/`,
   preserving their directory structure:
   * everything under the APK's `assets/` folder, **and**
   * the contents of the OBB (`main.*.obb` — it is just a ZIP; the `data/`,
     `models/`, `texdb/`, `audio/`, `text/`, `anim/`, `es2/`, … trees inside it
     go directly in `/switch/gtavc/`).
4. Copy `gtavc_nx.nro` into `/switch/gtavc/`.

Your SD card should end up with at least `/switch/gtavc/gtavc_nx.nro`,
`/switch/gtavc/libGame.so`, `/switch/gtavc/libc++_shared.so`, and the extracted
game data folders (`data/`, `models/`, `texdb/`, `audio/`, …) all inside
`/switch/gtavc/`.

### Notes

This will not work in applet/album mode (it needs the full memory + syscall set).
Launch it through a **game override** (hold R on an installed title) or a
forwarder.

Save games and settings are stored in `/switch/gtavc/`.

The port has a config file at `/switch/gtavc/gtavc_nx.cfg`, created on first run:
* `screen_width` / `screen_height` — render resolution; `-1` picks 1280x720 in
  handheld and 1920x1080 docked
* `trilinear_filter` — `1` forces trilinear texture filtering
* `show_fps` — `1` draws a small FPS counter in the top-left corner
* `fps_cap_30` — `1` enables the wrapper's 30 FPS cap
* `auto_boot_delay` — launcher countdown in seconds (`1`, `3`, `5`, or `10`)
* `ps2_corona_rotation` — `1` PS2 Corona Sun
* `ps2_color_filter` — `1` PS2 Color filter
* `sprint_any_surface` — `0` Sprinting on any surface is allowed
* `remove_air_resistance` — `0` Remove "ExtraAirResistance" flag
* `show_wanted_stars` — `0` Always drawable wanted stars
* `disable_ped_spec` — `1` Removed specular lighting on pedestrians
* `no_offscreen_despawn` — `0` Cars and peds don't despawn when you look away
* `mobile_widgets` — `0` Hidden Mobile Widgets

### Tips and Tricks

- You can input PC cheats by pressing **R3** + **L3** to open the on-screen keyboard. See [CHEATS.md](CHEATS.md) for available and unavailable cheats (you can input cheat codes in lowercase as well as uppercase).
- Due to expired licensing, some songs were cut from the game. See [MUSIC.md](MUSIC.md) for a list of removed tracks and a guide on how to restore them.
- Console-style HUD (optional). Drop a custom `Adjustable.cfg` into `switch/gtavc/` for the console HUD (e.g. radar in the bottom-left corner). Since **v2.11.311** no longer includes `data/360Default1280x720.cfg`, take it from the older **v2.10** build and rename it to `Adjustable.cfg`. It's a leftover from the Xbox 360 version.
- In order to reduce occasional stutters in-game, delete both `switch/gtavc/scache_small_low.txt` and `switch/gtavc/scache_small.txt`, then create a copy of the `switch/gtavc/scache.txt` file to have two version of it. (for example `scache(1).txt` so in the end you end up with both `scache.txt` and `scache(1).txt` inside the `switch/gtavc/` folder), then rename `scache.txt` to `scache_small.txt` and `scache(1).txt` to `scache_small_low.txt` . This will however make the loading screen longer since it needs to compile more shaders ahead.
  - Mesa stores its persistent single-file shader cache under `switch/gtavc/shadercache/mesa_shader_cache_sf`. Delete that directory only when diagnosing a corrupt cache.

### Mod Settings Menu

The SDL launcher opens on every boot with the game cover centered. Select the
cover to launch, or open **Options** to change the port's fixes and features.
Changes are saved immediately to `gtavc_nx.cfg`.

### How to build
